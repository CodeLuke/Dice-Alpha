# Dice Alpha
This is the alpha version of [Dice-Jack](https://github.com/LukeBriggsDev/Dice-Jack). It is almost entirely different in every single way except for the dice. This repo is for the primarily for those who want to see how a simple windows forms application works. 

An explanation of the game and its successor can be found at [my blog](https://www.lukebriggs.dev/inspection-and-dissection-dice-jack/)
